☁️ Cloud Projects

Welcome to the **Cloud Projects** repository! This is a curated collection of cloud-based projects that showcase my hands-on experience with various cloud platforms and services like **AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, and cloud-native technologies including **Serverless**, **Containers**, **Storage**, **Security**, and more.

Each project is organized into its own sub-folder with a dedicated README that includes architecture, code, setup instructions, and demo details.
